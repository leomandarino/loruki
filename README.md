Loruki Tutorial from Traversy Media

I'm coding along with this tutorial for practice.

My objective is to get used to the workflow of building a website, using HTML and CSS.

Notes:

> Use utility class to create default styles to your elements

> Create variables for repeating properties

> Ctrl + k + u - On VS Code, adds a comment line automatically (I didn't know this and was super happy to find out lol)

> Using utility classes is a really great idea, gonna incorporate it!

> Separating the utility classes in a separate "utilities.css" file is good for organization

> Use 'ctrl + d' to select multiple items with the same characters and edit them

> Selectors: use '> *:first-child' to select the first item in a parent element (this is useful if you want to update this section)

> the "i" tag stands for icon, use it with 'font awesome' (good to know)


What I would have done differently:

> I'd use more rem/em on text sizes, instead of pixels

> I'd start building from small to big screens, adding complexity
