Loruki Tutorial from Traversy Media

I'm coding along with this tutorial for practice.

My objective is to get used to the workflow of building a website, using HTML and CSS.

Notes:

> Use utility class to create default styles to your elements

> Create variables for repeating properties

> Ctrl + k + u - On VS Code, adds a comment line automatically (I didn't know this and was super happy to find out lol)
